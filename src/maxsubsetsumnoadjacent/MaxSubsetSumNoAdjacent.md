Problem Statement : Max Subset Sum no adjacent

Difficulty : Medium
Category: Dynamic Programming

Problem Statement: Given an array of positive integers , find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array, if sum cant be generated return 0

Time Complexity:O(n) when n is the numnber of integers in the array.
Space Complexity:O(1) , this overrides the existing elements in the array instead of creating a new temp array.
