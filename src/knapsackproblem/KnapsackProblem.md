Problem Statement : Knapsack Problem

Difficulty : Hard
Category: Dynamic Programming

Problem Statement: Given an array of arrays, where each array have value and weight, identify items that can be put in a knapsack with a limited capacity, inorder to maximize the capacity.

Time Complexity:O(nc) when n is the numnber of elements array and c is the capactiy of the knapsack
Space Complexity:O(nc) , as we have to create a n*c matrix
